# Mission

As a Starcraft player I always thought it would be nice to have some persistent overlay that tracks my tasks and progress like how the mission objectives are displayed in an overlay in-game. This small app lets you CRUD your tasks on a Mac. The overlay is styled to match that in StarCraft2.

## Usage

Once you start the app, a circular icon should show up in the menu bar. Click the "Edit Objectives" to show the window where you can CRUD your tasks.

You can hide or show your overlay any time.
